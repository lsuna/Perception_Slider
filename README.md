# Perception_Slider
Perception is an image slider that explores how people percieve you versus how you actually feel in college. For this project, I decided to visualize what is typically thought of as the two most stressful years in college, freshman and senior year, since it would be the most relatable. I created all the graphics in Adobe Illustrator and programmed the slider using the JavaScript library, Phaser.js.
